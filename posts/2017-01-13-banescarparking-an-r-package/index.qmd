<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
<p>January exams are imminent, so I should be revising. Therefore I have written an R package...</p>
<p>Admittedly it is a little bit niche, but hopefully it will prove useful for the machine learning project I'm working on with BMLM (I have mentioned this project before - it was part of my motivation for [TDTVOD](../2017-01-27-summary-of-30-days-30-visualizations-1-dataset/index.qmd)).</p>
<p>The package isn't currently on CRAN (one day maybe!) but v0.1.1 can be found on GitHub here:</p>
<a href="https://github.com/owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking">https://github.com/owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking</a>
<p>and you can install it with</p>
```r
devtools::install_github("owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking")
```

<h4>UPDATE (23/01/2018)</h4>

<p>There have been loads of awesome updates to <code>BANEScarparking</code> since it was first released!</p>
<p>And <code>BANEScarparkinglite</code>, the dataless version, totally <em>is</em> on CRAN :D</p>
<p>You can find it here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=BANEScarparkinglite">https://cran.r-project.org/package=BANEScarparkinglite</a></p>
<p>So if you ever feel an urgent desire to analyse Bath & North East Somerset's historical parking records, you know what to do.</p>
