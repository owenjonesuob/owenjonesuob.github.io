Hey folks, it's been a while!

I did the thing from the meme and, having logged on intending to write a short blog post, ended up moving my entire blog to a new platform.

I have zero regrets about this - the previous handcrafted site was fun to build in the first place (many years ago now...); but I couldn't face re-learning how to build & deploy with Jekyll _againnnn_ on yet another laptop. So instead, here's a shiny new [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)-built site, tada!!

Particular thanks go to [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/disqus2giscus.html) and [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/) for their super handy posts about migrating comments from Disqus.

There are probably some rough edges that I've missed - dead links, dodgy formatting... please point me towards anything particularly ugly and I'll get it patched up.

And I promise that more actual gloriously content-filled blog posts _will_ actually happen now. Stay tuned!
