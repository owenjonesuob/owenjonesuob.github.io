    <h2>Odd's bodkins, it's a 404!</h2>
    <p>You seem to have found a project I haven't yet undertaken.</p>
    <p>I'm guessing that you either made a typo (have a quick check) or followed a dud link (sorry!).</p>
    <p>I can provide you with directions to either <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">the homepage</a>, or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts">an index of all posts</a>, but after that you're on your own. Choose wisely.</p>
