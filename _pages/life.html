<p>There is one thing in life that I want more than anything else. But she doesn't.</p>
<p>It distorts everything, every day; which isn't rational, but by definition love isn't rational. I'm fighting a constant battle with myself: rationality vs aching desire. Rationality makes slow, hard-fought progress, and then it is instantaneously picked up and dumped right back where it started. And the whole process is exhausting and painful.</p>
<p>I'm so thankful I met you. I'm so thankful to call you my friend. You've made me the happiest, and saddest, I have ever been. I wish there was a simple solution, but you're happy where you are and I can't let go.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is my problem, you see. Two or three hours have passed since I wrote the above, and now I feel fine. When it hits me it really does hit me very hard. I can't figure out whether I'm pretending I'm OK or not.</p>
