I thought I'd share another little time-saving trick I discovered earlier.

When I'm writing code I tend to use Git Bash to run commands, mostly because it (obviously!) works nicely with git and partly because... well, I think it looks nice. It's so colourful! This is a valid reason for liking something, right?

Anyway, when you run a command the first word is always an instruction to the terminal, either saying "do this yourself" (e.g. `cd`, `mkdir`) or "use this program to do the next thing". For example:



My go-to code/plaintext editor is [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). (It's great - I'd highly encourage you to have a look!)
