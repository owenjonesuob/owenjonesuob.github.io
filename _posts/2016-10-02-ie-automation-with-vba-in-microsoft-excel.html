excerpt: A rough-and-ready automated name-searching program in VBA
---
<p>A bit of context: as well as being a super-hard-working maths student (...), I am a peer mentor for eight first-year students who have just started maths courses at the university. I am, in fact, a 'lead' peer mentor - generally speaking this doesn't entail much more work than the peer mentoring itself, but occasionally there is a little bit of work to be done around the management of the peer mentoring scheme within the department.</p>
<p>A little while ago, I was sent an email by the maths department's Director of Studies asking if I would mind helping to mix up and then divide the new intake of maths students between the 42 peer mentors. Attached to this email was a list of the names of the new students in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Skipping forward to the point where I needed to let the other peer mentors know who they needed to contact, I decided that seeing as I had nothing else to be doing, I could save my fellow mentors a bit of time by finding the email addresses of the new students myself on the university computing system.</p>
<p>Four or five names in, however, I was already reassessing my benevolent decision - faced with another 320-odd names, and not willing to admit defeat, I decided to see if I could somehow automate the process.</p>
<p>Seeing as I was working in Excel, I came up with the idea of writing a VBA program that would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open my webmail client</li>
<li>Search for a person</li>
<li>Copy their email address into the Excel spreadsheet, next to their name</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of experimentation and a lot of digging around in HTML source code later, a very rough-and-ready, very situation-specific, but nonetheless functional program did eventually emerge.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p>[code language="vb"]<br />
Sub findemail()</p>
<p>' Launch an Internet Explorer window<br />
Set IE = CreateObject(&quot;InternetExplorer.Application&quot;)</p>
<p>IE.Visible = True</p>
<p>' Navigate to webmail client<br />
IE.Navigate &quot;http://mail.bath.ac.uk/&quot;</p>
<p>' Update Excel status bar<br />
Application.StatusBar = &quot;Bath mail client loading...&quot;</p>
<p>' Wait for page to load<br />
Do While IE.Busy<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 1, Now)<br />
Loop</p>
<p>' Add short delay to ensure all elements fully loaded<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 2, Now)</p>
<p>' Update Excel status bar<br />
Application.StatusBar = &quot;Finding mentee...&quot;</p>
<p>' Find &quot;People&quot; button on menu bar at top of webpage<br />
Set topButtons = IE.document.getElementById(&quot;_ariaId_20&quot;)</p>
<p>topButtons.Click</p>
<p>' Wait for page to load<br />
Do While IE.Busy<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 1, Now)<br />
Loop</p>
<p>' Add short delay to ensure all elements fully loaded<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 2, Now)</p>
<p>' Find &quot;Search people&quot; box<br />
Set searchbox = IE.document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;_n_o1 o365button ms-font-m ms-border-color-themeLighter&quot;)<br />
' Workaround to resolve issue occuring when trying to click single object<br />
For Each obj In searchbox<br />
obj.Click<br />
Next</p>
<p>' Add short delay for loading<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 1, Now)</p>
<p>' Input name from spreadsheet in &quot;Forename Surname&quot; format<br />
SendKeys ActiveSheet.Range(&quot;G&quot; &amp; ActiveCell.Row).Value &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; ActiveSheet.Range(&quot;F&quot; &amp; ActiveCell.Row).Value</p>
<p>' Wait to ensure name is pasted<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 1, Now)</p>
<p>' Find search button<br />
Set searchButton = IE.document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;_n_z searchImgWidth o365button ms-font-m&quot;)</p>
<p>' Workaround for single-object click issue mentioned earlier<br />
For Each obj In searchButton<br />
If obj.Type = &quot;button&quot; Then<br />
obj.Click<br />
End If<br />
Next</p>
<p>' Update Excel status bar<br />
Application.StatusBar = &quot;Getting mentee email...&quot;</p>
<p>' Give results time to load<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 2, Now)</p>
<p>' Create list of all results from search<br />
Set people = IE.document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;_pe_b _pe_s&quot;)</p>
<p>' There are 2 &quot;invisible&quot; non-result elements of the same class as the results, so a length-3 list means 1 person found<br />
' If no people or multiple people found, give an error message (manual intervention needed later)<br />
' Else find the person's email address on the page, and copy it into the spreadsheet<br />
If people.Length &lt;&gt; 3 Then</p>
<p>ActiveCell.Value = &quot;ERROR!&quot;</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>emailAddress = IE.document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;_rpc_41 ms-font-s allowTextSelection _rpc_m1 ms-font-color-themePrimary _rpc_p1&quot;).Item(0).innerText</p>
<p>ActiveCell.Value = emailAddress</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>' Close IE window<br />
IE.Quit</p>
<p>' Clear Excel status bar<br />
Application.StatusBar = False</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>'=============================================================================</p>
<p>Sub Go()</p>
<p>For Each cell In ActiveSheet.Range(&quot;J2:J326&quot;)<br />
cell.Select<br />
findemail<br />
' Wait to ensure process has finished before moving on to next cell<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 2, Now)<br />
Next</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>'=============================================================================</p>
<p>Sub GoFrom()</p>
<p>For Each cell In ActiveSheet.Range(ActiveCell, &quot;J326&quot;)<br />
cell.Select<br />
findemail<br />
' Wait to ensure process has finished before moving on to next cell<br />
Application.Wait DateAdd(&quot;s&quot;, 2, Now)<br />
Next</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And here's the program in action:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey3tHDzigHQ]</p>
<p>Writing the program, and running the whole list of names through it, probably took much longer than it would have done to find the email addresses manually; and certainly it would have been much easier to take the divide-and-conquer approach and ask the other mentors to find their own mentees' email addresses themselves. However, I did feel immensely proud of myself for rising to the challenge I had set myself, for creating a working program in a language I wasn't too familiar with and for helping out my fellow mentors.</p>
<p>The following day, I was sent an updated list of names by the department - with an extra column containing each student's email address.</p>
