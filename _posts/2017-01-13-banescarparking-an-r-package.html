<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
<p>January exams are imminent, so I should be revising. Therefore I have written an R package...</p>
<p>Admittedly it is a little bit niche, but hopefully it will prove useful for the machine learning project I'm working on with BMLM (I have mentioned this project before - it was part of my motivation for <a href="{{ site.baseulr}}/tdtvod-menu">TDTVOD</a>).</p>
<p>The package isn't currently on CRAN (one day maybe!) but v0.1.1 can be found on GitHub here:</p>
<a href="https://github.com/owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking">https://github.com/owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking</a>
<p>and you can install it with</p>
{% highlight r %}
devtools::install_github("owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking")
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>UPDATE (23/01/2018)</h3>

<p>There have been loads of awesome updates to <pre>BANEScarparking</pre> since it was first released!</p>
<p>And <pre>BANEScarparkinglite</pre>, the dataless version, totally <em>is</em> on CRAN :D</p>
<p>You can find it here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=BANEScarparkinglite">https://cran.r-project.org/package=BANEScarparkinglite</a></p>
<p>So if you ever feel an urgent desire to analyse Bath & North East Somerset's historical parking records, you know what to do.</p>
