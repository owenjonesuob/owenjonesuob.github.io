<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
<p>January exams are imminent, so I should be revising. Therefore I have written an R package...</p>
<p>Admittedly it is a little bit niche, but hopefully it will prove useful for the machine learning project I'm working on with BMLM (I have mentioned this project before - it was part of my motivation for <a href="https://owenjonesuob.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/30-days-30-visualizations-1-dataset/">TDTVOD</a>).</p>
<p>The package isn't currently on CRAN (one day maybe!) but v0.1.1 can be found on GitHub here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking</p>
<p>and you can install it with</p>
<pre>devtools::install_github("owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking")</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
