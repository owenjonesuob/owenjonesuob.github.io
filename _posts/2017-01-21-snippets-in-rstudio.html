excerpt: Mini time-saving abbreviations!
---
<p>I know, I know, this is probably old news to must regular users of RStudio. But these things are so useful - how had I not heard about them before?</p>
<p>In short, "code snippets" are little abbreviations that you can use when writing your code. You type a few letters and then hit TAB, in the same way you do to autocomplete functions; but a snippet can be used to insert a whole code template, for example, a <code>for</code> loop or <code>switch</code> statement.</p>
<p>And what's more, you can add your own snippets! Within the Code tab of the global options menu, there's a little "Edit snippets" button:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-790" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/codemenu.jpg?w=297" alt="codemenu" width="297" height="300" /></p>
<p>And then you can see the built-in snippets (in a whole bunch of languages), and add your own. <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets">This post from RStudio</a> explains the syntax (and, indeed, explains the whole concept of snippets better than I have done here!).</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted a quick way to add section dividers to my R scripts: so I've defined three new snippets for "single-" and "double-divider" and for a "heading" divider.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-792 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snippets.jpg" alt="snippets" width="994" height="872" /></p>
<p>Which work like so:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-791 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dvgif.gif" alt="dvgif" width="720" height="404" /></p>
<p>Type two letters, hit TAB. Much quicker than holding down the equals key!</p>
